# Refactor-Challenge

Making changes to an existing web page that follows accessibilitty standards and made it optimised for search engines.

## Description

On this challenge we made changes to existing HTML/CSS code to enhance a website to ensure better accesbility.

I was motivated to complete this to help consolidate what was learnt during classwork and to assess my understanding of the work. I also wanted to be able to highlight my strengths and weakness during the challenge.
I built this project to determine if I could help refactor exisiting HTML code with the emphasis being on acheiving accessbility on the website.

This particular project was able to solve the issue of lack of alt attribute elements which is essential for accesibility. By adopting semantic HTML elements we were able to give definitions to each section of the webpage. This therefore improves the users experience on the site. Additionally by optimising accesibility such websites rank better on search engines which is a benefit to that company.

I learned the importance of semantic elements in a project like this. I was able to better understand why we need image/icon alt attributes
